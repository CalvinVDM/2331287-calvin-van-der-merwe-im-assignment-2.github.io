    <h2>Week 2:The Medium is the Message</h2>
    <p>
      The medium is the message by Marshall McLuhan is an interesting piece of
      work. This reading expands and tells us how a medium affects the message
      we try to convey. The passage talks about how the medium of a message
      becomes part of the message and so enhances the meaning that is brought
      across through the combination of the medium and the message.
    </p>
    <p>
      The combination of the medium and the ideas that the message holds is
      something powerful that can affect the way we think and feel about certain
      topics so I believe in this reading McLuhan tries to show us the
      importance of how a medium works together with its contents to produce
      something that could change and have social, political, and economic
      consequences. This message could also affect the way we think about the
      topics it addresses and so it can also affect the understanding of a
      society. The medium is what conveys a message and so it also allows
      certain people to receive this message through accessibility and interest.
      Due to the fact that in today’s society information is so readily
      available it is hard for people to see all the information available on
      media today this also means that not everyone will see the message one is
      trying to convey. This is shown in the many ways that people try to draw
      the attention of others to certain things this could be and advert that
      pops up when one is watching a video on YouTube or when ads pop up during
      browsing the internet and since a message is shown this way in some
      mediums people will trust the information more the others. An example of
      this is if an advertisement pops up on Television majority of people will
      immediately assume it’s real and due to the fact that a lot of people
      watch TV it has credibility whereas if the same add pops up while one is
      one a random website it has much less value due to internet scams and
      viruses.
    </p>

    <p>
      I believe that in this reading McLuhan is trying to show that the media
      has a lot of power and even more so when it uses certain mediums. He warns
      that the way we perceive and consume media will make us act a certain way
      and believe certain things whereas not all people consume the same media
      which means that there will be division between people in society as some
      many people will believe different things about the same topic depending
      on the media which they consume. Since a lot of people are used to
      consuming media, it also means that many people are not aware of the type
      of media they consume and so a lot of false information is taken I and
      this is used to control and manipulate the vast majority of people into
      believing and agreeing with certain ideals and information.
    </p>

    <p>
      McLuhan’s reading can also be applied to things like games where one will
      enjoy playing certain games on certain platforms more then they do on
      other platforms. An example of this is the game “genshin impact” that is
      available of mobile, PC and console. Due the game being available on these
      platforms the way you play them is different and personally I prefer
      playing is on console due the fact that it has a controller. For me the
      controller allows easier movement and attacking as well as dodging and it
      feels like I have more control over what I am doing in the game. This will
      apply to everyone that plays the game as people will like it on different
      mediums and they experience the game better on said mediums.
    </p>

    <p>this is what i took from the reading "The Medium is the Message.</p>

    <h2>Week 4 - What is a browser? How do they work?</h2>

    <p>
      According to Mozilla a web browser is something that that takes you
      anywhere on the internet. This means that it will take you to any
      available place on the internet such as websites and search engines. A web
      browser gets information from these parts on the internet and displays it
      on the device you are using. This information is sent using http
      (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) which is used to tell the device and browser
      how text, videos and other forms of media are transmitted on the internet.
      (Mozilla, n.d.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Examples of web browsers include google chrome, internet explorer and
      opera. These browsers are used by devices to input information and search
      the internet for that information to display to the user. All browsers do
      not use and interpret information the same and so this means that on
      different browsers websites will look and function differently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Browsers use software called rendering engines to translate the data they
      receive from the internet into images and text. Hypertext Markup Language
      (HTML) is the language that the data is written in, and the rendering
      engines reads this code to provide us with the things we experience on the
      internet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main job of browsers consists of DNS resolution, HTTP exchange,
      Rendering and repeat. DNs resolution is the process where one enters a
      URL, and the browser will know which server need to connect to. The
      browser talks to this server in order to get and IP address so that the
      browser can find what the URL wants to display.
    </p>
    <p>
      HTTP exchange happens when our browser communicates with servers in order
      to get the information we are looking for. Is an exchange of a request
      from out browser and a reply from the server where we want the data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rendering is the process using the data we receive to render the text
      style images and visuals we see on whatever website we are looking for.
      Its is the combination of Html, CSS and JavaScript that creates and
      interactable website for use to see on our devices. (freeCodeCamp, 2018)

    <h2>Week 6 – The uses of Metadata – what, why, how</h2>
    <p>
      Metadata is often referred to as data that describes other data, its known
      as structured reference data that helps to sort and find out about the
      information is describes. The word “Meta is a prefix that basically means
      “and underlying definition or description” which mean that metadata is
      information that tell us more about the data we are looking at. This can
      make it easier to find and use instances of data and to see where it was
      found and use. (Kranz, n.d.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Why do we use metadata? We use metadata because it helps to improve the
      data we are using. The metadata makes up for the mistakes people make as
      people often lose or misplace data, so metadata is way to find the data we
      were using, and it makes sure we preserve and can re-use this data in the
      future. It also helps to show the credibility of the data we are using by
      showing when it was created or edited, and it also shown who created or
      edited it. (UNC, n.d.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Metadata is created anytime a document is modified or even deleted this is
      used to prolong and find data wherever we need it, and it will always make
      sure that the data we are using comes from a source and we can identify
      where or who that source is. It is useful as it basically shows us the
      history of any data we use and can help us if we ever need to verify data
      or find this data to use. (Kranz, n.d.)

    <h2>Week 9 – Critical Writing</h2>

    <p>
      I am analysing Graham et al’s “Toward a study of information geographies”. I found the content of this reading to be quite extraordinary and interesting as it dealt with concepts that I have never touched upon or thought about. The reading talks about the development of information based on its location and access geographically and how these can be improved so that this information is provided to everyone and so that everyone has access to it.
    </p>

    <ph2>
      Introduction: information geographies and (im)mutable augmentations
    </h2>

    <p>
      This chapter talks about the fact that information has always had a geography meaning that it originated, circulated as well as cultivated in certain areas. This tells us that because of the geography of information the way that information evolved was because of where it was used and so it developed based on its surroundings and area. This logic is then applied to the current era and talks about how the history relates to the development of information. It is then also explained how information was adapted to be more mobile and to physical so that it could be transported to different areas this was when information was written and condensed into physical copies such as books.
    </p>

    <p>
      This talks about how when information is left out certain things can be forgot or changes due to the lack of acknowledgement. An example is given that says if a restaurant is omitted from a map that the restaurant can cease to be a restaurant due to lack of service and lack of information regarding its location and services. This also talks about how much information we have on places and things such as places that provides good and or services.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Pre-digital geographies of information
    </h2>

    <p>
      This chapter talks about how information was stored and transferred before technology such as computers and tablets came into play. This therefore tells us about how tools and written pieces of information were used to gather more information or to understand certain things and concepts, like a compass or direction or a ruler for measurement. This chapter goes on to explain the circulation of information in areas and how the fact that the information is physical would affect how it develops.
    </p>

    <p>
      This means that due to the physical nature of the storage of information it was harder to transmit over a larger area such as a country, it would be harder for people of one side of the country to know of what happened on the other side of the country due to the circulation of newspapers not being a fast medium as it does not transfer information instantaneously.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Changing geographies after the information revolution?
    </h2>

    <p>
      This chapter talks about the fact that due to the revolution and development of data information has become a lot less localised and is now very easy to access almost everywhere in the world. Since information has now become digital it is easier to transfer information at high speeds to anyplace in the world if there is a device to interpret it. This means that if one has a device that can receive and communicate the data to the user of said device then one will have access to information of almost any kind that has been recorded as digital data.
    </p>

    <p>
      This chapter therefore talks about the power of the internet as a medium of transferring and relating data to people across the world and so how if one has access to the internet, they have access to this information as a moments notice. This made is so that the geographical placing of a person would not prohibit them from having access to all kinds of information.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Geographies of access and enablement
    </h2>

    <p>
      This chapter talks about the fact that digital devices are not always affordable and owned by people and so now that distance is not the problem that prohibits the connection of people to information but rather it is now the fact that people either do not have the device to access the internet so they have the information or that the people are unable to afford the price for bandwidth so that their device is able to access the internet so that they have this information.
    </p>

    <p>
      This chapter talks about the fact the most internet usage is concentrated in largely well-developed countries and that it’s because of affordability that many other countries and people are left out from using the information stored on the internet.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Geographies of participation
    </h2>

    <p>
      This chapter talks about the countries in the world that participate mostly in the orchestration of gathering and presenting information on the internet. This again looks at the geographical location of the amount of people and participates in the exchange and gathering of information on the internet and it is again seen and displayed that the countries that have a more well-developed economy will usually have more participation which means once again the geographical location and the circumstances of people will affect the access to information that those people have.
    </p>

    <p>
      It again becomes an issue of access to the pools of information gathered by society.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Geographies of representation
    </h2>

    <p>
      This chapter is focused on the way that information is provided and perceived by people due to their geographical location. This issue deals with the fact that across the world different languages are spoken and read meaning that for all the information to be in one certain language would once again limit and prohibit the access of information to certain individuals and people. This means that depending on where one was raised their ability to understand the information provided by the internet or by books will differ. If someone is raised in a place where they learn to speak and write Spanish or another language it will become hard to understand and interpret the information on the internet that is provided in English.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Conclusions: towards a study of information geographies
    </h2>

    <p>
      The conclusion to this topic talks about the fact that information needs to unfix and fixed at the same time meaning that information should not be constrained to books or the internet or newspapers but rather provided by any means that is available and that information should be fixed depending on the geographical location of people. This means that the information should be available in as many formats as possible but should also be easy to understand regardless on one’s location and language.
    </p>

    <p>
      The conclusion states that information is meant to be all inclusive to everyone regardless of circumstance and geography.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Reflection
    </h2>

    <p>
      I truly found this information to be interesting and that the topic talked about to be very new and unheard of to me. Because I speak and understand English it means that I can understand most information provided to me by the internet and there is also the fact that I have access to the internet at almost any time of day regardless of location and circumstance, so I am able to use this information at will.
    </p>

    <p>
      This topic really piqued my interest and made me think 0of how information has been exchanges and interpreted throughout history.

    <h2>Week 12 - Critical Writing - Critical Analysis of your own UX and UI</h2>

    <h2>
      What is UX and UI?
    </h2>

    <p>
      The term UX is used to describe User Experience. The user experience defines how people feel and are able interact with the UI of a website. UI is the term that is used to describe the User Interface. This is the things that the user interacts with in order to navigate one’s website or page.
    </p>

    <p>
      I think that the use of my UI was very basic. I had the pages listen at the top with each name and one was able to see what page they were on due too the change in background colour of the word that told the user what page they were on.
    </p>

    <p>
      I decided to keep my UI very simple due to the reading Convention and context by Mailloux. Is made me realise that majority of people are used to certain things and so it has become a norm for them to notice these things like having the background colour of a heading change to indicate that one is one this page when referring to a website.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Why have I made certain choices?
    </h2>

    <p>
      I decided to keep my UI very simple due to the reading Convention and context by Mailloux. Is made me realise that majority of people are used to certain things and so it has become a norm for them to notice these things like having the background colour of a heading change to indicate that one is one this page when referring to a website.
    </p>

    <p>
      It made the UI a lot easier to code when I decided to look at the interfaces a lot of other websites use, and it made it simpler to pan my layout so that it wasn’t too complicated.
    </p>

    <p>
      I decided to but a colour behind my world so that they were easier to read and understand as it was hard to read the text because of my background. I chose to make the website space themed because I though it would be different and interesting, but I soon realised that it was weird because of convention. What I mean by this is that if I decide to make something space themed one would automatically think that the content of the website would be about space exploration and such. This made it weird because the contents of my website had absolutely nothing to do with space. So next time I aim to make my theme more relatable to the content of said website.
    </p>

    <p>
      I think the UI was to simple and that the user experience was weird because of these decisions I aim to make better decision in the future and hope that I am able to improve both the Ui so that users understand everything and still find interaction meaningful and to make the user experience better in terms of understand why things on the website are the way they are.

    <h2>Week 14 - Critical Writing: Internet, Society and Design Justice</h2>

    <p>What is the internet?</p>

    <p>
      The internet is a network that allows all networks to connect to each other (What is the Internet? - The Internet Explained, n.d.). it allows anyone to create and offer services good and information around the world. It connects every human being to a source of information that can be accessed almost anywhere in the world.
    </p>

    <p>
      The internet is part of the digital work it is the collection of information that the humans have complied together. It is also used for entertainment purposes and has many other uses.
    </p>

    <p>
      As technology advances the internet become a larger part of our lives and can almost be seen in all parts of life today. It is integrated greatly with society. This is especially seen even more now that we have had a global pandemic. Due to this pandemic a lot of schools and universities were closed and did not allow students onto campus and so many students have been affected by this and were forces to start studying online to continue learning. Globally estimated around 1.5 billion students were affected due to Covid-19 (Glynos, 2020). This can also be seen through the popularity of social media as most of the world population has been affected and use social media daily.
    </p>

    <p>
      Defining the internet is become a very complex thing to do as in the world we living I today we cannot simply call the internet a library of sorts or something we all connect to it is more complex due to the things it provides us with and due to the wealth of information, entertainment and resources it provides it can be seen as one of the backbones of society in the modern world as everything will always pass through the internet in some manner whether it be as news or videos.
    </p>

    <p>
      What is Society?
    </p>

    <p>
      A society is an organised group of persons associated together for religious, benevolent, cultural, scientific, political, patriotic, or other purposes (dictionary, n.d.). this means that people in a society usually come from similar backgrounds and follow the same conventions and ideologies.
    </p>

    <p>
      Due to the internet being apart of modern society we can see that regarding the modern era the internet is one of the most useful and influential tools in society. It allows for things like communication across vast distances and even helps to provide information on any topic to its users. Majority of people today live a lot of their lives on the internet using social media and using other services the internet provides. This means that society is now connected throughout the entire world and that a lot of people are now able to communicate their conventions and ideologies in a way that most people around the global will be able to see.
    </p>

    <p>
      We call this global connectivity which allows everyone in the world to connect and talk to each other through the internet and the use of broadband which allows one to access the internet. This makes the internet an integral part of society today and due to that it can also do a lot of harm if misused. The internet stores everyone information as well and so a lot of people are vulnerable on the internet as they can be hacked or lured to places in real life due to the internet’s connectivity. There are even cases of identity theft and kidnaping that is enabled by the internet. (Daniolou, 2020)
    </p>

    <p>
      What is design justice?
    </p>

    <p>
      Design Justice is and an exploration of how design might be led by marginalized communities, dismantle structural inequality, and advance collective liberation and ecological survival (Costanza-Chock, 2020). This explores the relationship between design, power, and social justice. It’s a way to make sure that when making a design that the design is all inclusive and safe for anyone it doesn’t exclude any groups of people and does cause harm or exclusion to anyone.
    </p>

    <p>
      The purpose is to make sure that everyone has fair treatment, acknowledgement, and inclusion in the design of something. This fits into the internet by making the internet accessible to everyone and making sure that everyone can use it as well. Meaning that there is no language barrier or anything else that inhibits a person from using the internet to their advantage.

    <h2>Critical Reflection</h2>

    <p>
      in the making od this website it was alot harder in terms of the code and design used from the last one. my  main goal was to recreate the website and make it feel better in terms of the aethetics and feel of the website so i tried to mak the website feel alot more pleasing to the eyes and the code i tried to keep simple and practical so that nothing felt out of sorts or encombersome.
    </p>

    <h2>Creative Reflection</h2>

    <p>
      this time around i really like the design of the website and it felt alot more suitable for me personally i really thought that i made it alot better and more pleaseing in the users experience.i kept alot of my older ideas in terms of readability and aethetics with the placing of things but overall i am happy with the way it came out.
